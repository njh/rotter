What is Rotter ?
----------------

Rotter is a Recording of Transmission / Audio Logger for JACK. It was 
designed for use by radio stations, who are legally required to keep 
a recording of all their output. Rotter runs continuously, writing to 
a new file every at regular intervals (typically every hour). 


Rotter can output files in various different structures, either all files 
in a single directory or create a directory structure:

flat: /root_directory/YYYY-MM-DD-HH.suffix
hierarchy: /root_directory/YYYY/MM/DD/HH/archive.suffix
combo: /root_directory/YYYY/MM/DD/HH/YYYY-MM-DD-HH.suffix
dailydir: /root_directory/YYYY-MM-DD/YYYY-MM-DD-HH.suffix
accurate: /root_directory/YYYY-MM-DD/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm-ss-uu.suffix

The advantage of using a folder hierarchy is that you can store related
files in the hour's directory. The "accurate" structure stores the
start time of the hourly file to an accuracy of one hundredth of a
second.

Start logging audio to hourly files in /var/archives.
Rotter will automatically connect itself to the first two JACK output ports 
it finds and encode to MPEG Layer 3 audio at 128kbps. Each hour it will 
delete files older than 1000 hours (42 days). Verbose mode means it will 
display more informational messages.
