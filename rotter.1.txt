NAME
----
rotter - a recording of transmission / audio logger for JACK


SYNOPSIS
--------
'rotter' [options] <directory>


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Rotter is a Recording of Transmission / Audio Logger for JACK.
It was designed for use by radio stations, who are legally required
to keep a recording of all their output. Rotter runs continuously,
writing to a new file at regular intervals (by default every hour).

Rotter can output files in different layouts, either all files in
a single directory, or creating a directory structure as required.

Custom file layouts may be specified, using a strftime-style format
string, or one of the following predefined file layouts:

  flat: /root_directory/YYYY-MM-DD-HH.suffix
  hierarchy: /root_directory/YYYY/MM/DD/HH/archive.suffix
  combo: /root_directory/YYYY/MM/DD/HH/YYYY-MM-DD-HH.suffix
  dailydir: /root_directory/YYYY-MM-DD/YYYY-MM-DD-HH.suffix
  accurate: /root_directory/YYYY-MM-DD/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm-ss-uu.suffix

The advantage of using a folder hierarchy is that you can store related 
files in the hour's directory. The "accurate" structure stores the
start time of the hourly file to an accuracy of one hundredth of a
second.


OPTIONS
-------

-a::
        Automatically connect JACK ports to the first two JACK
        input ports found.

-f <format>::
        Select the output format of the log files. See the rotter
        help screen for a list of supported output format names.

-b <bitrate>::
        Select the bitrate (in kbps) of the log file. This parameter
        is only supported by bitstream formats (MPEG Audio).

-c <channels>::
        Set the number of input channels to be logged. This number of
        JACK ports will be created. Should either 1 or 2.

-n <name>::
        Choose the name of the Jack client to register as.

-N <filename>::
        Choose a filename prefix for the archive files created (default 'archive').

-p <secs>::
        Specify the period of each archive file in seconds. The default is 1 hour
        (-p 3600). As an example, this can be used to make rotter create a new
        file at the start of every minute, using -p 60. Take care that the chosen
        file layout includes sufficient time precision.
        
-d <hours>::
        Specifies the number of hours of audio to keep before it is
        deleted. Files are deleted at the start of every hour, based
        on the files modification date. Default is to not delete files.

-R <secs>::
        Sets the length (in seconds) of the ringbuffer. This is the buffer
        between the internal audio grabber and the audio encoder. If you have
        a slow machine you might want to try increating the size of the buffer.

-L <layout>::
        Choose a file layout option for the archive files created.
        See above for a list of pre-defined layout formats, or specify a custom
        layout using strftime format specifiers, for example:

        -L "%Y-%m-%d/studio-1/%H%M.flac"
        will generate files like: [root]/2012-06-05/studio-1/1300.flac

        See your system's strftime documentation for a full list of available
        format specifiers (man strftime).

-j::
        By default rotter will automatically try and start jackd if it
        isn't running. This option disables that feature.

-u::
        Use UTC rather than the default of local time in forming archive
        filenames. Human-readable log messages will still be timestamped
        with the local time.

-v::
        Enable verbose mode. Display more messages about what rotter is doing.

-q::
        Enable quiet mode. Only display error messages.



EXAMPLES
--------

'rotter -a -f mp3 -d 1000 -b 160 -v /var/achives'

Start logging audio to hourly files in /var/archives.
Rotter will automatically connect itself to the first two JACK output
ports it finds and encode to MPEG Layer 3 audio at 128kbps.
Each hour it will delete files older than 1000 hours (42 days).
Verbose mode means it will display more informational messages.
